# rocketstrpy

It's a simulation tool that takes inputs from rocketpy and allows the user to perform structural analysis, enabling rapid iteration of high powered rocket designs. I am waiting for rocketpy to update to V1.1, so that they have support for supersonic aerodynamics, which is required because pretty much any rocket going subsonic doesn't need a structural analysis performed on it.
